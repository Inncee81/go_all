清晨时分
the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his
侄子哈利的房间。

“这星期第三次！”
Third time this week!
他在桌子上咆哮。 
he roared across the table.
“如果你做不到
If you can't
控制那只猫头鹰，它必须走！”
control that owl, it'll have to go!
哈利再次尝试解释。
Harry tried, yet again, to explain.
“她很无聊，”他说。 
She's bored, he said.
“她曾经在外面飞来飞去。如果可以的话
She's used to flying around outside. If I could
晚上让她出去-”

“我看起来很蠢吗？”
Do I look stupid?
弗农大叔咆哮，有些煎蛋晃来晃去

从他浓密的胡子。 
from his bushy mustache.
“我知道那只猫头鹰放开会怎样
I know what'll happen if that owl's let

他与妻子矮牵牛交换了黑暗的表情。
He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.
哈利试图反驳，但他的话被很长一段时间淹没了，
Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long,
Dursleys的儿子Dudley大声叫。
loud belch from the Dursleys' son, Dudley.
“我想要更多的培根。”
I want more bacon.
“煎锅里还有更多甜食，”佩妮尤妮姨妈说，
There's more in the frying pan, sweetums, said Aunt Petunia,
看着她大儿子的雾蒙蒙的眼睛。 
turning misty eyes on her massive son.
“我们必须在建立你的同时
We must build you up while
我们有机会...我不喜欢学校食物的声音
we've got the chance ... I don't like the sound of that school food
...”
...
“胡说八道，佩妮，当我在冶炼厂时，我从不饿。”
Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,
弗农叔叔发自内心地说道。 
said Uncle Vernon heartily.
“达德利够了，不是吗，儿子？”
Dudley gets enough, don't you, son?
达德利（Dudley）身材魁梧，他的屁股下垂在两侧
Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the
厨房椅子，笑了，转向哈利。
kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry.
“通过煎锅。”
Pass the frying pan.
“你忘记了魔语，”哈利烦躁地说。
You've forgotten the magic word, said Harry irritably.
这个简单的句子对整个家庭的影响是
The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was
不可思议：达德利倒吸了一口气，从椅子上摔下来，
incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that
震撼了整个厨房；
shook the whole kitchen;
德思礼太太尖叫了一声，
Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and
她的手拍到嘴里；
clapped her hands to her mouth;
德思礼先生跳了起来，
Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet,
血管在他的太阳穴中th动。
veins throbbing in his temples.
“我的意思是“请”！
I meant please!
哈利很快说。 
said Harry quickly.
“我不是那个意思-”
I didn't mean -
“我告诉你的是什么，”他的叔叔喷口吐口水。
WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU, thundered his uncle, spraying spit
在桌子上，“关于我们说“ M”字

Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was
试图让达德利站起来。
trying to heave Dudley to his feet.
“好吧，”哈利说，“好吧……”
All right, said Harry, all right... 
弗农叔叔坐下，呼吸得像缠绕的犀牛，
Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and
看着哈利从他那双细小而锐利的眼睛的角落里走出来。
watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.
自从哈利放暑假回家以来，叔叔
Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle
弗农一直像对待炸弹一样对待他，随时可能爆炸

哈利·波特（Harry Potter）是一名巫师-他在大一的第一年就崭新了
Harry Potter was a wizard - a wizard fresh from his first year at
霍格华兹魔法与巫术学院。

达斯利一家被巫师称为麻瓜
The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles
（不是一滴神奇的血液在他们的血管中），
(not a drop of magical blood in their veins),
就他们而言，在家里有一个巫师是

最深的耻辱。

弗农大叔甚至挂锁

一岁的时候，哈利以某种方式幸免于难

那时，弗农叔叔重要地清了清嗓子，说：
At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said,
“现在，众所周知，今天是非常重要的一天。”
Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.
哈利抬起头，几乎不敢相信。
Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.
“这很可能是我职业生涯中最重要的一天，”
This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career, 
弗农大叔说。
said Uncle Vernon.
哈利回去敬酒。
Harry went back to his toast.

CHAPTER TWO
多比的警告
DOBBY'S WARNING
哈利设法不大喊大叫，但这是一件近距离的事。
Harry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing.
小一点

当他们凝视彼此时，哈利从大厅听到了达德利的声音。
As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley's voice from the hall.
“梅森先生和太太，我可以拿你的外套吗？”
May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?
这个生物从床上滑下来，弯下腰，以至于它的末端

“呃，你好。”哈利紧张地说道。

“哈利·波特！”

“多比，先生。只是多比。多比是家养小精灵，”这种生物说。
Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf, said the creature.
“真的吗？”
Oh - really?
哈利说。 
said Harry.

你在这里有什么特别的原因吗？”
is there any particular reason you're here?
“哦，是的，先生。”多比认真地说道。 
Oh, yes, sir, said Dobby earnestly.
“多比来告诉你，
Dobby has come to tell you,
先生...这很困难，先生...多比想知道从哪里开始...”
sir ... it is difficult, sir ... Dobby wonders where to begin ...
“坐下。”哈利客气地指着床。
Sit down, said Harry politely, pointing at the bed.
令他惊恐的是，小精灵哭了起来-非常吵的眼泪。
To his horror, the elf burst into tears - very noisy tears.
“坐下！”
S-sit down!
他哭了。 
he wailed.
“永远……永远……”
Never ... never ever ... 
哈利以为他听到楼下的声音步履蹒跚。
Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter.
“我很抱歉，”他小声说道，“我不是要冒犯您或其他任何东西。”
I'm sorry, he whispered, I didn't mean to offend you or anything.

多比免费。多比将为家人服务，直到他去世，先生...”

哈利凝视着。
Harry stared.
“而且我以为我在这里再呆四个星期很不好，”

he said.
“这使Dursleys听起来几乎像人一样。没有人能

哈利几乎立刻希望他不讲话。

that's Hermione, she -
但是他很快停了下来，因为考虑赫敏是痛苦的。
But he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful.
“哈利·波特谦虚谦虚，”多比虔诚地说道，他的宝珠-

像眼睛在闪烁。

“哈利·波特（Harry Potter）没有说过他对“何-

他又停了下来。
He stopped again.
考虑罗恩也很痛苦。
Thinking about Ron was painful, too.
多比向哈利倾斜，他的眼睛像前灯一样睁大。
Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.
“多比听见了，”他嘶哑地说，“哈利·波特遇到了黑暗

哈利点点头，多比的眼泪突然闪着泪。

哈利立刻说。

多比发出一声有趣的窒息声，然后撞到头
Dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head

多比慢慢地摇了摇头。
Slowly, Dobby shook his head.
“不是-不是他必须被提名的人，先生。”

但是多比的眼睛睁大了，他似乎想尽力
But Dobby's eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give
哈利一个提示。
Harry a hint.
但是，哈利完全迷路了。
Harry, however, was completely lost.
“他没有兄弟，对吗？”
He hasn't got a brother, has he?
多比摇了摇头，他的眼睛比以往任何时候都宽。
Dobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever.

“甚至不写信给哈利·波特的朋友？”

多比狡猾地说。
said Dobby slyly.
“我希望他们来过-等一下，”哈利皱着眉头说。
I expect they've just been - wait a minute, said Harry, frowning.
“你怎么知道我的朋友没有写信给我？”
How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?
多比打着他的脚。
Dobby shuffled his feet.
“哈利·波特一定不要对多比生气。多比做到了最好……”
Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Dobby did it for the best ...

罗恩说：“我听说你在讲Parseltongue。” 
I heard you speaking Parseltongue, said Ron.
“蛇语。你

“我说的是另一种语言？但是-我没有意识到-我该怎么说

a language without knowing I can speak it?
罗恩摇了摇头。
Ron shook his head.
他和赫敏都好像
Both he and Hermione were looking as though
有人死了

哈利看不出有什么可怕的东西。
Harry couldn't see what was so terrible.
“你想告诉我阻止一条大蛇怎么了？

“这很重要。”赫敏终于低声说道。

这就是为什么斯莱特林宫的象征是蛇。”
That's why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.

哈利凝视着帽子内的黑色，等待着。
Harry stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting.

“你错了，”他大声说着那寂静无声的帽子。

哈利认为它看起来病得很厉害。
Harry thought it looked very ill.
它的眼睛呆滞

哈利正好赶上魔杖。
Harry reached his wand just in time.
洛克哈特几乎没有举起他的，
Lockhart had barely raised his,
当哈利吼叫：“ Expelliarmus！”
when Harry bellowed, Expelliarmus!
洛克哈特被向后炸开，跌落在他的后备箱上。
Lockhart was blasted backward, falling over his trunk;
他的魔杖飞了起来
his wand flew
高高的向空中

罗恩抓住了它，把它扔开了窗外。
Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.
“不应该让斯内普教授教我们那个，”哈利说。
Shouldn't have let Professor Snape teach us that one, said Harry
愤怒地将洛克哈特的后备箱踢到一边。

洛克哈特抬头看着

他，再次虚弱。

哈利仍在用魔杖指着他。
Harry was still pointing his wand at him.
“你要我做什么？”
What d'you want me to do?
洛克哈特微弱地说。 
said Lockhart weakly.
“我不知道

密室在哪里。

我无能为力。”
There's nothing I can do.
“你真幸运。”哈利说，迫使洛克哈特站起来。
You're in luck, said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint.
“我们认为我们知道它在哪里。里面有什么。走吧。”
We think we know where it is. And what's inside it. Let's go.
他们把洛克哈特赶出他的办公室，走到最近的楼梯，
They marched Lockhart out of his office and down the nearest stairs,
沿着黑暗的走廊，信息在墙上闪闪发光，

“问你怎么死的，”哈利说。

默特尔的整个面貌一下子改变了。

她看起来好像

“噢，那太可怕了。”她津津乐道。

“怎么样？”

哈利说。

“不知道，”默特尔安静地说道。

“你到底在哪里看到眼睛？”

哈利说。
said Harry.
“在那儿，”默特尔含糊地指着水槽里的水说。
Somewhere there, said Myrtle, pointing vaguely toward the sink in
她的厕所前面。

哈利和罗恩赶紧过去。
Harry and Ron hurried over to it.
洛克哈特站得很好，
Lockhart was standing well back, a

它看起来像一个普通的水槽。
It looked like an ordinary sink.
他们检查了里面的每一英寸

然后哈利看到了：抓伤了

在其中一个铜水龙头的侧面是一条小蛇。
on the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake.
“那把水龙头从来没有用过，”默特尔在试图转动它时明亮地说道。
That tap's never worked, said Myrtle brightly as he tried to turn it.
“哈利，”罗恩说。 
Harry, said Ron.
“说点什么。Parseltongue中的东西。”
Say something. Something in Parseltongue.
“但是-”哈利认真思考。
But - Harry thought hard.
他只有一次设法
The only times he'd ever managed to
说Parseltongue是当他面对一条真正的蛇时。

“打开，”他说。

他看着罗恩，后者摇了摇头。
He looked at Ron, who shook his head.
他说：“英语。”

哈利回头看了看那条蛇，愿意相信那条蛇还活着。
Harry looked back at the snake, willing himself to believe it was alive.
如果他摇了摇头，烛光使它看起来好像

哈利听到罗恩喘着粗气，再次抬头。
Harry heard Ron gasp and looked up again.
他已经下定决心

他要做什么。

他说：“我要去那儿。”

“我也是，”罗恩说。

停了一下。
There was a pause.
“好吧，您似乎几乎不需要我，”洛克哈特带着阴影说道。
Well, you hardly seem to need me, said Lockhart, with a shadow
他以前的笑容

“我只是-”
I'll just -
他把手放在门把手上，但罗恩和哈利都指出
He put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both pointed
他们的魔杖对准他。
their wands at him.
“你可以先走。”罗恩咆哮道。
You can go first, Ron snarled.
洛克哈特面无表情，脸色苍白，走近开幕式。
White-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening.
“男孩，”他说，声音微弱。 
Boys, he said, his voice feeble.
“男孩，这有什么用？”
Boys, what good will it do?


哈利用魔杖刺了他背。
Harry jabbed him in the back with his wand.
洛克哈特滑了双腿
Lockhart slid his legs
进入管道。
into the pipe.
“我真的不认为-”他开始说，但罗恩推了他一下，
I really don't think - he started to say, but Ron gave him a push,
他滑了出来。

哈利迅速跟进。
Harry followed quickly.
他降低了自己
He lowered himself
慢慢地进入管道，然后放开。

这就像冲下无尽的，黏糊糊的，黑暗的幻灯片。
It was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide.

在他的身后，他可以听到罗恩，在弯道上微微拍打。

然后，就像他开始担心会发生什么一样

他们三个都转身凝视着前方的黑暗。
All three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead.

隧道太黑了，他们只能看见前方一小段距离。
The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead.
他们在潮湿的墙壁上的影子在烛光下显得异常可怕。
Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight.
“记住，”当他们谨慎地向前走时，哈利轻声说，
Remember, Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward,
“任何动静的迹象，请立即闭上眼睛……”

但是隧道像坟墓一样安静，还有第一个意外的声音

它没有动。

“也许是睡着了。”他呼吸，回头看向另外两个。

Lockhart's hands were pressed over his eyes.
哈利转过身来

然后他独自一人越过那条巨大的蛇皮。

不久，罗恩拉扯着移动岩石的遥远的声音消失了。

东西从柱子上狂跳。
something thrashing wildly off the pillars.
他忍不住了-他睁开眼睛，斜视着什么
He couldn't help it - he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what

巨大的毒蛇，明亮，有毒的绿色，厚如橡木的树干，
The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk,
在空中高高举起，它的钝顶正在编织
had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving
醉在支柱之间。

当哈利颤抖时，准备关闭他的

眼睛转过头，他看到了使蛇分心的东西。

福克斯（Fawkes）的脑袋高高飞扬，而蛇怪则响着
Fawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping
像一把军刀一样细细的毒牙对他怒不可遏。
furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers.
福克斯俯冲而下。
Fawkes dived.
他长长的金色喙沉没在视线中，
His long golden beak sank out of sight and a
黑血的骤然洒落在地板上。
sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor.
蛇的尾巴
The snake's tail
跳了起来，险些想念哈利，在哈利无法关门之前

眼睛转过身-哈利直视着它的脸，看到它

鲜血流到地板上，蛇在吐痰
blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting
在痛苦中。

“没有！”
NO!
哈利听到里德尔尖叫。 
Harry heard Riddle screaming.
“离开伯德！离开
LEAVE THE BIRD! LEAVE
鸟！
THE BIRD!
男孩在你身后。
THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU.
你还是可以的
YOU CAN STILL SMELL
他。

杀了他！”
KILL HIM!
瞎眼的蛇摇曳，迷惑，仍然致命。
The blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly.
福克斯原为

“救救我，救救我，”哈利疯狂地说，“有人-任何人！
Help me, help me, Harry muttered wildly, someone - anyone!
蛇的尾巴再次在地板上鞭打。
The snake's tail whipped across the floor again.
哈里躲开了。
Harry ducked.
他的脸上有些软。
Something soft hit his face.
蛇怪把分拣帽扫到了哈利的怀里。
The basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry's arms.
哈利

抓住了

那是他剩下的，唯一的机会-他把它撞到了他的身上

“救救我-救救我-”哈利想，眼睛在帽子下拧紧了。
Help me - help me - Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the hat.
“请帮我！”
Please help me!
没有回音。
There was no answering voice.
相反，帽子收缩了，好像
Instead, the hat contracted, as though
一只看不见的手紧紧地挤压着它。
an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly.
哈利的头顶上满是沉重的东西，
Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry's head,
差点把他淘汰
almost knocking him out.
星星在眼前眨动，他抓住了
Stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed
帽子的顶部将其拉下，感觉有些长而硬

帽子内部出现了一条闪闪发光的银色剑，其手柄
A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle
闪闪发光的红宝石蛋大小。
glittering with rubies the size of eggs.
“杀死男孩！离开伯德！男孩在你身后。
KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU.
嗅探器-聪明的他。”
SNIFF - SMELL HIM.
哈利站起来，准备好了。
Harry was on his feet, ready.
蛇怪的头跌落，身体
The basilisk's head was falling, its body
盘绕着，扭曲着面对他，撞到了柱子。
coiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him.
他可以看到
He could see the
巨大，血腥的眼窝，看到嘴巴张开，足够宽

吞噬他整个身体，排成一排的fang牙，只要他的剑稀薄，

闪闪发光，有毒...
glittering, venomous ...
它盲目地扑了过去。
It lunged blindly.
哈利躲开了，撞到了房间的墙上。
Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall.
扑了过去
It lunged
再次，它的分叉的舌头猛击了哈利的身边。
again, and its forked tongue lashed Harry's side.
他举起剑
He raised the sword
在他的手中。
in both his hands.
蛇怪再次隆起，这次的目标是真实的-哈利扔了
The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true -- Harry threw
他的全部重量都落在了剑后面，并将其推到屋顶
his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof

但是随着温暖的血液浸湿了哈利的手臂，他感到了灼痛
But as warm blood drenched Harry's arms, he felt a searing pain just
肘部上方

一个长而毒的毒牙正在下沉，

深深地刺入他的手臂，蛇怪在龙骨上盘旋了

哈利从墙上滑下来。

即使他放下毒牙，看着自己的鲜血

分庭正在解散
The Chamber was dissolving
暗淡的颜色。
in a whirl of dull color.
一片猩红色的游动过去，哈利听到一阵柔和的爪声
A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws
在他旁边。

“福克斯，”哈利厚重地说。 
Fawkes, said Harry thickly.
“你真棒，福克斯……”
You were fantastic, Fawkes ...
他觉得那只鸟在蛇的头上站了漂亮的头。
He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent's
fang已经刺穿了他。
fang had pierced him.
他听见回荡的脚步声，然后有黑影移进来
He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in

“你已经死了，哈利·波特，”里德尔在他上方的声音说。 
You're dead, Harry Potter, said Riddle's voice above him.
“死。
Dead.
甚至邓布利多的鸟也知道。
Even Dumbledore's bird knows it.
波特，你知道他在做什么吗？
Do you see what he's doing, Potter?
他在哭。”
He's crying.
哈利眨眨眼。
Harry blinked.
福克斯的头滑入和移出焦点。
Fawkes's head slid in and out of focus.
浓密的珍珠泪

“我要坐在这里看着你死，哈利·波特。慢慢来。
I'm going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. Take your time.
我不着急。”
I'm in no hurry.
哈利昏昏欲睡。
Harry felt drowsy.
他周围的一切似乎都在旋转。
Everything around him seemed to be spinning.
“就这样结束了著名的哈利·波特，”里德尔遥远的声音说。 
So ends the famous Harry Potter, said Riddle's distant voice.
“单独

But was this dying?
分庭似乎没有变黑，而是

“滚开，鸟。”里德尔的声音突然说道。 
Get away, bird, said Riddle's voice suddenly.
“离开他-

我说，走开！”
I said, get away!
哈利抬起头。
Harry raised his head.
里德尔指着哈利的魔杖

像枪一样的爆炸声，福克斯又乘飞机
there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a

He raised the wand.
然后，一阵翅膀，福克斯飞回头顶，
Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and
日记掉进了哈利的腿。
something fell into Harry's lap - the diary.
瞬间，魔杖的哈利和里德尔都抬起头，凝视着它。
For a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it.
然后，没有思考，没有考虑，好像他打算
Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to
一直做，哈利抓住了他旁边地板上的蛇怪牙。

哈利的魔杖拍打声落在地板上，在那里

“不，”罗恩对哈利抬起眉头。

哈利弯下腰，抬头看着那长长的黑烟斗。
Harry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe.

然后有一个尖叫声。

You saved her! You saved her! How did you do it?
麦格教授微弱地说：“我想我们都想知道这一点。”
I think we'd all like to know that, said Professor McGonagall weakly.
韦斯莱夫人放开了犹豫了片刻的哈利，然后
Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a moment, then
走到桌子上，放在上面的分拣帽，
walked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the
红宝石镶嵌的剑，以及里德尔日记中剩下的东西。

然后他开始告诉他们一切。

里德尔的日记不再起作用了……他们怎么能证明
